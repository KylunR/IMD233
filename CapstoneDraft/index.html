        <h1>Kylun Robbins Capstone Draft</h1>
        <p>I plan on creating a portfolio to showcase my projects, experience, and skills for 
            my final Capstone project.</p>

        <h3>Who are you as a designer?</h3>
        <p>I am a functional and minimal designer.  I believe the user's interactions with 
            software should be seamless and natural.  I do not believe the user should have any 
            confusion when interacting with the system, nor should they waste any time having to deal
            with complicated or bloated user interfaces.  
        </p>

        <h3>What is the most important thing you want people to take away from viewing your portfolio?</h3>
        <p>I want the viewer to take away key information about who I am as a person, a student, and 
            a Software Engineer.  This includes learning about my work experience, hobbies, projects,
            and technical skills.  I would like this information to be presented in a clean and understandable
            fashion in which the user can access all the information they desire. 
        </p>        
        
        <h3>What are your three strongest skills?</h3>
        <p>I believe my three strongest skills are: <br>
            - Technical skills  <br>
            - Organization of data <br>
            - Time management <br> <br>

            However, I plan to greatly improve my design skills throughout the process of implementing
            my Capstone project. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>What are you using for inspiration?</h3>
        <p>I am using fellow Computer Science students and Software Engineers' portfolios for 
            inspiration on this project.  I am drawn to user interfaces and portfolios that have a 
            very clean and straighfoward design.  This allows the viewer to easily navigate and 
            process information.  I really enjoy the user interface of Apple products including 
            macOS and iOS. <br> <br>

            Examples of portfolios that I enjoy greatly include: <br>
             - <a href="https://brittanychiang.com/">https://brittanychiang.com/</a> <br> 
             - <a href="http://kalynnakano.com/">http://kalynnakano.com/</a> <br>
             - <a href="http://iriskramer.com/">http://iriskramer.com/</a> <br>
